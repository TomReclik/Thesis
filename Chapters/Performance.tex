In this chapter firstly the performance of the two components of the architecture described in chapter \ref{cha:Architecture} will be studied, as well as the performance of the combined classifier. For this analysis the available data is split into $80\% $ used for learning and $20\% $ used for the evaluation of the networks predictions. Furthermore the input values that fall into the interval $\{ 0, \dots , 255\}$ are linearly scaled into the interval $[-1,1]$. In order to gain a balanced dataset undersampling, as explained in \ref{cha:datasets}, was used. \\

In the end of this chapter the combined classifier is applied to the tracking of the evolution of damage sites in in-situ experiments.


\section{First Classifier}

As explained in chapter \ref{cha:Architecture}, the first network of the overall architecture is trained to distinguish between inclusions and all other possible damage mechanisms. The networks were trained for $70$ epochs using an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of $0.001$, $\beta_1=0.9$, $\beta_2=0.999$, $\epsilon=10^{-8}$, and a learning rate decay of $0$. The dataset is split into $80\%$ used for training and $20\%$ for testing. 

\subsection{Architecture}

Due to the small amount of available data, optimization of a networks architecture is not promising to increase its accuracy. Therefore three networks were chosen that performed well in the ImageNet challenge with similar window sizes, namely the Xception network \cite{Xception}, the InceptionResNetV2 network \cite{InceptionResNetV2}, and the InceptionV3 network \cite{InceptionV3}. Their accuracies can be seen in table \ref{tab:AccuracyComparisonNetworks}. Since the InceptionV3 network performed best it was chosen for the first classifier.\\

 \end{center}
 \caption{Accuracy of the networks trained on different training sets evaluated on the available datasets.}
\end{table}

\subsection{Ex-Situ Data}
Training and evaluating the network on the ex-situ data results in an accuracy of $0.906$. Inspecting the precision vs recall plot shown in figure \ref{fig:InceptionExSituCLAvsACC}, indicates that this network works near optimum. It is possible to introduce a threshold in order to increase the classifiers accuracy, at the cost of more sites not being labeled. E.g. a desired accuracy of $95\%$ would result in a classification rate of about $83\%$.

In figure \ref{fig:InceptionExSituPredictedIncTrueRest} sites are shown that the classifier misclassified damage sites that stem from martensite cracking, interface decohesion, or notch effect. The damage site shown in \ref{sub:IDasInc1} shows itself as a large void, probably leading the network to assign the class inclusion. In the immediate surrounding of the damage site shown in figure \ref{sub:NasInc} is an inclusion in the lower left part, leading to the classifier interpreting the input as belonging to a site showing an inclusion. For the two damage sites \ref{sub:MasInc} and \ref{sub:IDasInc2} a justification of the assignment of the class inclusion is difficult. \\

In figure \ref{fig:InceptionExSituPredictedRestTrueInc} damage sites are shown that are inclusions but have not been recognized by the network as such.

\subsection{Generalization to In-Situ Data}

While working only with the data recorded ex-situ, the network generalized well on this dataset, the networks performance drops significantly to just about a classifier randomly assigning class labels, the accuracy on the different datasets can be seen in table \ref{tab:AccuracyComparisonInception}. By including the in-situ data into the training dataset, the networks performance was increased drastically. This behavior is also shown in figure \ref{fig:Inception_ex_vs_in}. \\

\begin{table}[H]
 \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{@{} *5l @{}} \toprule[2pt]
   Training set &  &Test set&  \\\midrule
    & ex-situ  & in-situ  & all   \\

\subsection{Overall Performance}
The network achieved an accuracy of $0.92$ on all available data. Of the $76$ inclusion sites $66$ were classified correctly, while

Of the $76$ inclusion sites present in the test dataset $66$ were correctly identified as inclusions while the remaining $10$ were misclassified as stemming from a different mechanism. 


Overall an accuracy of $0.92$ was found. \\

\subsection{Choosing a Threshold}
The output of the network can be seen as a probability that a certain damage site belongs to a damage class. By choosing a threshold above which the classifier should classify a given damage site, a trade-off has to be made between the desired accuracy and the classification rate. In figure \ref{fig:InceptionACC_EFF_THETA} the accuracy of the first network together with its classification rate plotted against the threshold can be seen. Requiring the accuracy to be $95\%$ would correspond to a threshold of $\theta = 0.7$ and a classification rate of $92\%$. The remaining $8\%$ of damage sites have to be labeled afterwards by hand. 
%
%
%%Due to the first classifier acting as a filter for the next classifier, it is necessary to minimize the number of falsely classified damage sites. By introducing a threshold for the network to only decide for a damage site to be of a category if the returned probability exceeds it, the number of falsely classified damage sites can be minimized, at the cost of a lower efficiency. By labeling the not classified damage sites by hand, those can be later introduced back into the system as new training data, representing points in the input space not learned by the network. The accuracy together with the efficiency against the threshold are shown in figure \ref{fig:InceptionACC_EFF_THETA}. A reasonable choice for this threshold is $\theta=0.7$, resulting in an accuracy of $95\%$ classifying $92\%$ of all damage sites.

%\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Comparison}
In figure \ref{fig:TPR_comparison} the precision of both differently trained networks are shown. As one can see the network performed well, while working only with ex-situ data. Transferring the network to be used on in-situ data the networks precision dropped immensely, rendering the network useless for classifying in-situ images. However, by including a small portion of in-situ data in the training of the network, the number of damage sites wrongly classified by the network as inclusions becomes negligible above a certain threshold. 

\newpage
\section{Second Classifier}
Due to the smaller nature of the remaining classes, compared to inclusions, for the second classifier a simpler network architecture was decided upon. In order to compare the performance of such a simple architecture to the performance of a complex architecture, the Inception network, their respective precision recall plots are shown in \ref{fig:InVsEE}. As can be seen for these smaller sites the naive architecture outperforms the InceptionV3 network. It was therefor decided upon to use the EERACN network as described in ... .


\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{InceptionVsEERACN_all.pdf}
\caption{Performance comparison between the InceptionV3 network and the EERACN network distinguishing between brittle and ductile mechanisms}
\label{fig:InVsEE}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Ex-Situ Data}
The network trained on the ex-situ dataset evaluated on the ex-situ dataset resulted in an accuracy of $0.71$. In figure \ref{fig:EERACNExSituCLAvsACC_allClasses} the overall accuracy and the true positive rates are plotted against the classification rate. As can be seen the classifier was able to classify martensite crackings, but had difficulties classifying interface decohesion sites and notch effect sites. \\
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{/SecondClassifier/EERACNExSituCLAvsACC_allClasses.pdf}
\caption{}
\label{fig:EERACNExSituCLAvsACC_allClasses}
\end{figure}
The confusion matrix shows that the classifier had problems distinguishing between interface decohesions and martensite crackings, where more interface decohesion sites were classified as martensite crackings as vice versa. Furthermore problems arose between interface decohesions and notch effects. \\

\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
126 & 38 & 19 \\
8 & 101 & 23 \\
5 & 19 & 47 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

In figure \ref{fig:ExSituMartensiteSamples}, the some martensite cracking sites are shown that were classified differently, were the sites were chosen that were classified with the highest confidence. In figure \ref{sub:ExSituMartensiteSamplesM} a typical martensite cracking is shown that was classified correctly, with a confidence of $0.999962$. In figure \ref{sub:ExSituMartensiteSamplesI} is shown that the classifier identified with a confidence of $0.973105$ as interface decohesion, this might result from the blurry nature of this particular site and the wide shape of the void. In figure \ref{sub:ExSituMartensiteSamplesN} the classifier assigned the label of notch effect with a confidence of $0.099998$ ,......

In figure \ref{fig:ExSituInterfaceDecohesionSamples} interface decohesion sites are shown that were classified with a high confidence by the network. In figure \ref{sub:ExSituInterfaceDecohesionSamplesM} The damage sites was classified as a martensite cracking, with a confidence of $0.99724$. This can be explained by the fact that the interface decoheison is located between two martensite grains. In figure \ref{sub:ExSituInterfaceDecohesionSamplesID} an interface decohesion site is shown classified correctly with a confidence of $0.987877$. Finally in figure \ref{sub:ExSituInterfaceDecohesionSamplesN} a damage site is shown that was classified as a notch effect with a confidence of $0.924455$. This site shows the characteristics of a notch effect as it is located between two martensite grains, therefore the classification as a notch effect is justifiable.

In figure \ref{fig:ExSituNotchEffectSamples} notch effect sites are shown that were classified with a high confidence by the network. In figure \ref{sub:ExSituNotchEffectSamplesM} the damage site was classified as a martensite cracking, with a confidence of $0.985994$. Since this site shows both the characteristica of a notch effect and the cracking of a thin martensite cracking both classes can be interpreted as correct. In figure \ref{sub:ExSituNotchEffectSamplesI} the classifier identified an interface decohesion site as the underlying damage mechanism, with a confidence of $0.823874$. While this site is misclassified, the classifier had less confidence in its prediction than in previous cases of misclassification. Finally in figure \ref{sub:ExSituNotchEffectSamplesN} the notch effect site was classified correctly with a confidence of $0.9853783$.

\subsection{Transition to In-Situ Data}
Transition $0.71\rightarrow 0.65$\\

Similarly to the generalization issues that arose for the first classifier, the accuracy of the second classifier when evaluated on the in-situ data, dropped noticeably, while not as significantly as for the first classifier. The 

Similarly to the drop in accuracy for the first classifier during the transition from ex-situ to in-situ data, a drop in the accuracy can be seen for the second classifier. The observed drop is not as dramatical as the one observed earlier but still recognizable.

\subsection{Overall Performance}

The second classifier achieves an accuracy of ... on the entire available dataset with a mean accuracy of ... . In figure \ref{fig:SecondClassifierOverallAllClasses} the accuracy and the true positive rates are plotted against the efficiency. \\

\begin{figure}

\label{fig:SecondClassifierOverallAllClasses}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:InSituMartensiteSamples} martensite cracking sites are shown, that were classified in different ways by the second classifier. Site \ref{sub:InSituMartensiteSamplesM} shows the classifier recognizing a martensite cracking with a high confidence of $0.999788$. In figure \ref{sub:InSituMartensiteSamplesI} the damage site was classified as an interface decohesion, with a confidence of $0.906806$. While it can be seen that the martensite island was cracked, a void exists between the martensite islands and the ferrite matrix. This void was probably the cause for the classifier at arriving at interface decohesion as the underlying damage mechanism. In the last site \ref{sub:InSituMartensiteSamplesN}, the damage site was classified as a notch effect, with a confidence of $0.657974$. As the void is between two martensite islands, that might have been connected before the cracking, this sites shows the characteristics of a notch effect. The main difference between this site and typical notch effect damage sites is the elongated shape of the void.

\subsection{Brittle versus Ductile Damage Mechanisms}
Furthermore a further split of the class hierarchy was considered. Instead of distinguishing between the three remaining classes, martensite cracking, interface decohesion, and notch effect, the second classifier should distinguish between brittle and ductile damage mechanisms. Therefore interface decohesions and notch effects are grouped into one class. In figure \ref{fig:2vs3Classes} the true positive rate can be seen 
Furthermore we tested whether it is sensible to train a network capable of only distinguishing between brittle damage mechanisms (Martensite cracking) and ductile damage mechanisms (interface decohesion and notch effects) involved in the formation of voids. As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:2vs3Classes} a network trained to distinguish ductile damage mechanisms in interface decohesion and notch effects performs just as well if not better in distinguishing between brittle and ductile damage mechanisms as a network trained just for that task.

\section{Combined Classifier}

\subsection{Combined Accuracy}

\subsection{Classification of Shadows}


\subsection{In-Situ Tracking}
In order to track the evolution of damage sites, both classifiers were trained on all available data with the training parameters as described previously. \\

The damage sites were tracked from one panorama to the next using a rather primitive algorithm. At first the expected position of a damage site was calculated by using the coordinates of the damage sites and correcting it by the elongation of the panorama. By now extracting a window around the damage site and a search window around the expected position in previous and/or following panoramas of size ... . In order to reduce the required computational resources both the window containing the damage site and the search window were reduced in size using max-pooling with a window size of $2\times 2$ and a stride of $2$. Then the window containing the damage site was moved across the search window calculating the difference between pixel values, and the position was determined by the position at which the deviation was minimal. In the following some selected damage sites and their evolution will be shown. \\

In figures \ref{fig:MCEV1} and \ref{fig:MCEV2} the evolution of two martensite cracking sides are shown. In figures \ref{fig:NEEV1} and \ref{fig:NEEV2} the evolution of two notch effect sides are shown. Two effects can be seen, firstly one can see that the voids increase in size and secondly that the surface deepens around the void. \\

For early damage sites in early stages of deformation the classification algorithm found $15$ inclusions of which $13$ where classified correctly, corresponding to an accuracy of about $0.86$ for inclusion sites. Of the $54$ found martensite cracking damage sites $42$ were classified correctly, an accuracy of about $0.78$, of the $16$ interface decohesion damage sites $12$ were classified correctly, corresponding to an accuracy of about $0.75$, of the $8$ notch effect damage sites $6$ were classified correctly, corresponding to an accuracy of about $0.75$, and $32$ sites were not classified. While the set of samples is barely statistically relevant, the trend described beforehand was reproduced. \\

For higher stages of deformation the classifier rarely classified damage sites correctly. Furthermore the localization algorithm performed very poorly finding many shadows. This effect can be explained by the formation of surface reliefs, and the evolved nature of many damage sites in later evolutions, as newly nucleated damage sites rarely occur. 
While the classification of damage sites in early stages of deformation worked reasonably well, in later stages the misclassification rate increased drastically. This can partly be explained due to the formation of surface reliefs at higher stages of deformation. Another possibility is that 

\subsection{Generalization}

Applying the combined classifier to a dual-phase steel, that is different from the one the classifier has been trained on, the accuracy drops significantly. In figure \ref{fig:newMaterial} a different dual-phase steel microstructure is shown. As can be seen the martensite islands have a very different appearance. Standing out is the the fine surface structure of martensite and the bright border. This seems to lead the first classifier to find many inclusion sites were there are none.

%%Due to the first network acting as a filter for inclusions, it is necessary to minimize the number of damage sites falsely classified as inclusions or equivalently minimizing the number of false negatives. The relevant quantity for inspecting the performance under these conditions of a binary classifier, in this case the neural network, is its precision (positive predictive value) defined by
%%\begin{equation}
%%PPV = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}
%%\end{equation}
%%where $TP$ is the number of correctly classified inclusions and $FP$ is the number of other damage sites classified as inclusions. \\
%%On the other hand for the network to be useful, the number of correctly classified inclusions should be maximized, in order to reduce the amount of work necessary to relabel remaining damage sites by hand. 
%
%%\subsection{Ex-situ to in-situ}
%%While the first classifier, responsible for filtering out the inclusion sites, performed well on the ex-situ data sets, problems arose while trying to use it for the classification of in-situ damage sites. By using some of the in-situ data for the training of the network, its performance was substantially increased. The data sets for training and testing of the classifier are shown in the following table. \\

%\subsubsection{Training excluding in-situ data}
%Without including the in-situ data in the training set of the network, it characterized $52$ out of the $62$ inclusion sites correctly, while also classifying $164$ out $409$ sites that aren't inclusions as inclusions. Since the purpose of the first network is to filter out inclusions, this performance would make it inapplicable. While some of the inclusion sites not labeled as inclusions, can pass through the system and have to be labeled afterwards by hand, labeling sites that aren't inclusions with a high confidence as inclusions poses a huge problem for its usage as a filtering system. 

%\subsubsection{Training including in-situ data}
%By including some of the in-situ data into the training set, $44$ out of the $62$ inclusions sites were classified correctly as inclusions, performing slightly worse than the network trained on only the ex-situ data set. However none of the remaining $409$ sites were classified as inclusions.

%\subsubsection{Training including all data}
%Due to new data being created, one more test was included. The performance of the network trained on the final dataset is shown in figure \ref{fig:FirstClassifierFinal}. As can be seen the performance of the network
