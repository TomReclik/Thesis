\chapter{Workflow}

Given a desired accuracy the internal thresholds of the CNNs used in the classifier have to be adjusted. This results in the classifier not being able to classify all damage sites in a given panorama. Nevertheless even for high thresholds this algorithm is capable to reduce the required time for the classification of damage sites. In the following a workflow is proposed.
